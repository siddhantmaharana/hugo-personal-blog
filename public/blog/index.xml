      <description>In this notebook, we would use the Google Analytics API to fetch the data from our Google Analytics account. The resultant csv can subsequnetly be written to a preferred database.
For getting data from google analytics, we need to set up a project in our google developers account and obtain a keyfile (in json format).
The module below builds a service object and takes various parameters such as api_name, api_version, scope, key_file_location, and service_account_email</description>

      <description>Donâ€™t you love excel or google spreadsheet for that matter. The formulas and flexibilities. Too much freedom to enjoy. What if we can link our google analytics data with our very own spreadsheet and our sheets would be updated automatically. Every morning, one glance and we are straight into the zone. No clutter! Read on to know how you can get that under your belt.
I hope you are familiar with the terms such as dimensions and metrics which you can leverage to get the data in your very own sheets.</description>
