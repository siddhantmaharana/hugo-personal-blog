Rather than relying on older algorithms such as VADER and Textblob, this method models a classifier from scratch which also takes into account the presence of features such as emoticons, punctuations, exclamations, hashtags and other characters to determine the sentiment of the tweet.

This project classifies tweets as either positive or negative using various machine learning models such as Naive baeyes, Random Forest and others.
