Domestic US companies submit annual reports on Forms 10-K,8-K etc.These forms provide firms with a unique opportunity to inform investors on an ongoing basis, and for firmâ€™s executives to express their expectations for the future, as well as their interpretations of the past.

This project uses the text in these SEC documents to train a classifier on the sentiment based on the price movements. It uses several neural network architectures such as RNN and LSTM to build this classifier.

Further, this project compares the word embeddings produced from these classifiers and compares with the pre-trained word-2-vec embeddings.
